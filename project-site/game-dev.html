            <h2>The Gauntlet</h2>
            <p>
                Navigate a series of platforming challenges and make it to the end. This is a relatively simple platforming game that I made as my first project in Unity when learning the engine. I then edited and upgraded it to submit it for the FCS Tech Fair where it won first place in the county then won third place in the Ga State Technology Competition in the digital game design category.

            <img src="images/Balancing Act.png" alt="Balancing Act Title Screen">
            <p>
                A fun balance game where you have to try to stack blocks for as long as possible. This is a fun puzzle game that while simple is quite fun. This was my second game I made in Unity and was an exploration of Unity's 2D and physics systems. Created for the 2021-22 FCS Tech Fair where it won first place in the county but did not place in the Ga State Technology Competition in the digital game design category.

            <h2>The Tower</h2>
            <div class="split-paragraph">
                <p>The wizard who created you has been turned on by their own creations and your siblings, who are now using the defensive protocols of the tower to generate more floors between you and the wizard, with each floor getting longer and harder as you progress.</p>
                <p>This is a dungeon crawler roguelike where you combine runes of shape, element, and effect to create spells to battle against the forces of your fellow golems gone rogue. This was one of my more recent games I developed, and it is by far the most complex of any I had made before. It also took quite the time investment.</p>
                <p>Created for the 2023-24 FCS Tech Fair where it won first place in the county, then it won second place in the Ga State Technology Competition in the digital game design category</p>
