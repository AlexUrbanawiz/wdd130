        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This is a place to organize and chronicle my personal projects so I have easy access to them and a description of them as well.  This is mainly for my own personal use, but it also has use as a place to direct people to if they want to see more of my work.</p>
        <p>I mainly develop in c#, though occasionally I work in python. I do most of my game development in Unity, but am learning Godot to broaden my horizons.

      <h3>Game Development</h3>
      <p>The Tower</p>
<p>The wizard who created you has been turned on by their own creations and your siblings, who are now using the defensive protocols of the tower to generate more floors between you and the wizard, with each floor getting longer and harder as you progress.</p>
<p>This is a dungeon crawler roguelike where you combine runes of shape, element, and effect to create spells to battle against the forces of your fellow golems gone rogue. This was one of my more recent games I developed, and it is by far the most complex of any I had made before. It also took quite the time investment.</p>
<p>Created for the 2023-24 FCS Tech Fair where it won first place in the county, then it won second place in the Ga State Technology Competition in the digital game design category.</p>
<p>Balancing Act</p>
<p>A fun balance game where you have to try to stack blocks for as long as possible.</p>
<p>This is a fun puzzle game that while simple is quite fun. This was my second game I made in Unity and was an exploration of Unity's 2D and physics systems.</p>
<p>Created for the 2021-22 FCS Tech Fair where it won first place in the county but did not place in the Ga State Technology Competition in the digital game design category.</p>
<p>The Gauntlet</p>
<p>Navigate a series of platforming challenges and make it to the end.</p>
<p>This is a relatively simple platforming game that I made as my first project in Unity when learning the engine. I then edited and upgraded it to submit it for the FCS Tech Fair where it won first place in the county then won third place in the Ga State Technology Competition in the digital game design category.</p>
<p>Prism Defense</p>
<p>An in-progress tower defense game where you defend against hordes of monsters by bouncing beams of light between enemies. You can use different crystals and other objects to manipulate the beams to add new effects to combat the monsters.</p>

      <h3>Other Projects</h3>
      <p>Recipe Planner</p>
<p>This is a python project that is designed to help people figure out what to eat. You can add recipes via csv file or through the GUI. You can rank the importance of taste, time, and cost for each recipe, then after they are sorted you can pick on and see its recipe. This was a decently complicated project that I decided to make because I wanted something to help me with my issues deciding what to make for dinner when I would forget the various options I had.</p>
<p>Tavern Keep Simulator</p>
<p>A simple text based simulator written in C#, where you attempt to run a tavern. At the start of each day you can stock up on food and check your finances, then when the day starts you get customers who have a preferred meal, and if you serve them their preferred meal fast enough then you get full cash, but if you take too long or serve them the wrong food then you will get reduced money.  While there aren't real consequences for serving the average customer incorrectly, beware of the inspector. The inspector will arrive and not only be harsher than the average customer but if you mess up serving them then your tavern will be shut down and the game over. As you progress through the days you serve more customers, and inspectors appear more frequently.</p>
